this lesson required alot of attention to detail. reorgonizing the .css file, and putting comments so it wasent a jungle.
the HTML needed a bit of work. alt tags and the search engine optimaization link was broken. changing the .header command to header once i canged the div type. changed the title and added a favicon. changed the hero image positioning.
